# Introduction
Across diverse languages and frameworks, some tested and trusted sets of steps/procedures have solved problems in the software world. These processes form the core of many solutions to specific issues. On their own, they are not the solutions to these particular problems, but they form the core upon which various solutions lies upon. These set of steps/patterns are what we refer to as Design Patterns.

# What are Design Patterns?
Design patterns are a series of patterns that provides a template or description of how you can solve a common problem. On their own, they are not complete solutions to problems but instead offer an explanation or way to solve a general re-occurring problem in the world of software design.

As a result of the similarities between issues raised, there was a need for a unified way of solving these common problems. That was what brought up the initial set of design patterns. You might have applied many of these solutions while developing a product(well yeah!). They are solutions that go deep into software development and tend to solve core problems without restricting them to a language or framework.

# Importance of Design Patterns
Dsign patterns provide you with lots of benefits, some of which include:

<li>Poviding a general standard for communication among developers. 
<li> Reducing development time and speeding up the development process.
<li>Providing proven solutions to common re-occurring problems.
<li>Provides best practices to get a clean reusable, and bug-free codebase.
<li>Providing a core/foundation upon which you can build solutions to re-occurring issues in software design 

## Creational Design Patterns
These are the design patterns that deal with the way Classes and Objects are created/instantiated. There are five design patterns in the Creational Design Pattern category. They are:
### <li> Abstract Factory
### <li> Factory
### <li> Builder
### <li> Prototype
### <li> Singleton


## Structural Design Patterns




## Behavioural Design Patterns
